I'm interested in the Robotics Toolbox for MATLAB created by petercorke. It brings robotics specific functionality to MATLAB and exploits the native capabilities of MATLAB (linear algebra, portability, graphics). The toolbox includes a lot of models such as robot motion models (unicycle, bicycle), path planning algorithms (bug, distance transform, D*, PRM), kinodynamic planning (lattice, RRT), localization (EKF, particle filter), map building (EKF) and simultaneous localization and mapping (EKF), and a Simulink model a of non-holonomic vehicle. The Toolbox also including a detailed Simulink model for a quadrotor flying robot.
